# Command line
AlphaDIA offers a command line interface to perform searches. In fact, even the GUI uses the command line interface internally. For reprodicable searches, method optimization or cluster and cloud use, the command line can be quite usefull.

## Usage
Before starting, please make sure that alphaDIA is correctly installed and up to date.
```bash
alphadia --check
```

To get an overview of all possible arguments, you can use

```bash
alphadia -h
```

Which should return

```
usage: alphadia [-h] [--version] [--output [OUTPUT]] [--file FILE]
                [--directory DIRECTORY] [--regex [REGEX]]
                [--library [LIBRARY]] [--fasta FASTA] [--config [CONFIG]]
                [--config-dict [CONFIG_DICT]]

```

## Setting up a search
The follwoing section will focus on how to set up a search using bash on mac or linux. For windows, please use a `.ps1` powershell script.
Create a new bash script named `search.sh` and enter it.

### 1. Basics
```bash
vim search.sh
```
We will write the command across multiple lines to make it more legible.
First, choose an output folder with the `-o` option, where all of the search results will be stored.

```
alphadia \
    -o /my/folder/output \
```

### 2. Input Files
Next add some raw files to the search with the `-f` option

```
    -f /my/raw/files1/exploris007_experiment1_rep1.raw \
    -f /my/raw/files1/exploris007_experiment1_rep2.raw \
```
AlphaDIA also supports to add whole directories to the search using the `d` option
```
    -d /my/raw/files2 \
```

Furthermore, files can be filtered by providing a regex filter using `--regex`. This allows for example to select a mass spec output folder and select by the experiment.
```
    --regex ".*_experiment1_.*\.raw$" \
```

### 3. Libraries
You can provide alphaDIA with an existing alphaBase `.hdf` or generic `.tsv` library.
Use the `--library` option to provide a library location
```
    --library speclib.single_species.hdf \
```

You can also provide a fasta file for reannotation of the library using the `--fasta` option.
Please note, if library prediction is enabled, the fasta file will not only be used for reannotation but will be digested and in-silico prediction of spectral library will be performed with peptDeep.

```
    --fasta human_reviewed_2024_03_11.fasta \
```

### 4. Configuration
To control the behaviour of alphaDIA's search, you will want to provide a `config.yaml` file.
All settings defined in this file will update the default parameters of alphaDIA.

You can either write it from scratch or use a `config.yaml` generated in a GUI search.

```
    --config "config_astral_first_pass.yaml" \
```

Sometimes, for example when optimizing a single parameter or building multi step workflows, you want to change only a single parameters on top of an existing configuration. Therefore, alphaDIA offers the `--config-dict` option, which leds you access all parameters from the command line.
```
    --config-dict "{\"library_prediction\":{\"nce\":26}}"
```

### 5. Summary
The full script looks like:
```bash
alphadia \
    -o /my/folder/output \
    -f /my/raw/files1/exploris007_experiment1_rep1.raw \
    -f /my/raw/files1/exploris007_experiment1_rep2.raw \
    -d /my/raw/files2 \
    --regex ".*_experiment1_.*\.raw$" \
    --library speclib.single_species.hdf \
    --fasta human_reviewed_2024_03_11.fasta \
    --config config_astral_first_pass.yaml \
    --config-dict "{\"library_prediction\":{\"nce\":26}}"
```

## Advanced

### Restarting
During the main search, alphaDIA processes each raw file independently.
After each file, quantification results are saved to `<output_folder>/quant/<raw_file_name>`,
which can be used as a checkpoint in case the processing is interrupted.

The config switch `general.reuse_quant` enables skipping raw file processing
when quantification results already exist, which is useful for
distributed searches or re-running FDR analysis with different parameters.

When enabled: Before processing each raw file, checks if quantification results already exist.
If so, skips processing entirely and reuses existing quantification.
If not, the file is being quanted.
After all quantifications are available, the workflow continues normally, combining results from all files.

The `--quant-dir` CLI parameter (Config: `quant_directory`, default: null)
can be used to specify the directory containing quantification results.

On startup, the current configuration is dumped as `frozen_config.yaml`, which contains all information to reproduce this run.

Combining these three concepts, here's an example how to reuse an existing quantification (from the `previous_run` directory), but create additional
output (`peptide_level_lfq`)
```
alphadia -o ./output_dir --quant-dir ./previous_run/quant --config ./previous_run/frozen_config.yaml --config-dict '{"general": {"reuse_quant": "True"}, "search_output": {"peptide_level_lfq": "True"}}'
```
